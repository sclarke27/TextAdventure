# TextAdventure
Simple text based choose your own adventure game made in Unity 4.6 for udemny.com course. Using lessons learned from sections 1, 3, and 4 from the course I added a small bit of additional functionality outside of what the course asked for. 
This version of NumberWizard uses boolean member variables to allow the player to pick up and drop items inside the prison cell. Doing this will alter the description of the cell, things in it, and the options which the player has. This version also has a simple menu system so the player isnt dropped right into the main text and so the player can exit the game.
